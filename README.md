<h2 align="center">Credit Card Approval Prediction System</h2>

ðŸ“œ I leveraged machine learning techniques to analyze credit card data and predict credit card approval. Here, the project is entailed from data cleaning and pre-processing to model building and evaluation.

ðŸ“œ These are the steps that I followed:

ðŸ”¹ Data cleaning & pre-processing: I examined the credit dataset, handling missing values and addressing outliers to ensure the integrity.  
ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering: New features were extracted to enhance the accuracy of the model.  
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization: Using matplotlib and seaborn, I visualized distributions of the dataset using bar charts, histograms, and box plots.  
ðŸ”¹ Feature selection: Highly correlated features were selected using a heat map and correlation matrix to build the model.  
ðŸ”¹ Handling imbalance: The target values of the dataset were imbalanced. To avoid overfitting, SMOTE was used.  
ðŸ”¹ Model building & Training: I built models using machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Multiple models were trained to predict credit card approval status accurately.  
ðŸ”¹ Model Evaluation: Using various accuracy testing methods such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision, and recall, I evaluated each model's performance to select the most robust solution.

ðŸ“œ At the end of the project, I have a robust model that could predict credit card approvals accurately. This helps banks make better decisions about credit card approvals.
